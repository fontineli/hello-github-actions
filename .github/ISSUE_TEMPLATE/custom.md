## Nice work!

You've created your first GitHub Action and this course is now complete! I'll stop responding but the fun doesn't have to stop here.

## Want to keep learning?

<!-- Continue learning about actions by taking the next course in the [GitHub Actions Learning Path]() -->

In this repository:

- Your merge should trigger your action again, check it out in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/goodquestiondev/hello-github-actions/actions).
- The `Dockerfile` contains metadata for your action. Try changing some of that. You could, for example, change the icon that displays when the action is running.
- Change the `MY_NAME` environment variable to use your name instead of Mona's in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- Change the contents of `entrypoint.sh` to output a different message.
